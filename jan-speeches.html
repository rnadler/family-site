<p align=center><b>Mom 70<sup>th</sup> Birthday</b><br>June 5, 1998</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to thank everyone for coming and especially for keeping the surprise.  
Mom made it clear she didn't want a party and Dad and I would have suffered the 
consequences if she had had found out.  We still may suffer, but at least it 
will be for a shorter period of time.  Which leads me my speech about Mom.
</p>
<p>Mom always made it clear the order of things in our house.  
There was never any doubt of what was expected of us, how to behave, or who was boss.  
Dad was, and still is, the boss because Mom says so, and whatever Mom says, goes.
</p>
<p>I've never had any doubt of Mom's opinion, either.  She has a way of letting me 
know without directly stating it and without making me feel I need to have the same one.  
For example, "Use it in good health" means whatever it is I have chosen 
(clothes, furniture, etc.) may not have been what she would have chosen, but if that's 
what makes me happy, that's all that matters.  As a matter of fact, I may be wearing this dress in good health.
</p>
<p>Even Mom's advice has always turned out to be right.  What she told me when I 
left for college is true:  Socks and hangers do have lives of their own and 
you're never a little pregnant.  Pay attention Joshua and Carly.
</p>
<p>Mom has always been the back bone of our family.  As was traditional when I was 
growing up, Dad worked and Mom took care of the household and raised the kids.  
But Mom not only took care of us.  She was and continues to be a devoted wife, 
mother and now grandmother.  During my first mid-life crisis of returning to 
college Mom made her self available to  me unconditionally.  There were several times 
I called her early in the morning because both of my children were ill and I needed to 
get to school.  She was there for me, as usual.  I could count on it.  And the best 
part is, it hasn't stopped.  Mom is still my loyal supporter.  She's consistently 
there for me and my family.  When I observe the parents my brothers and I have become, 
it's easy to see where we get our priority of and commitment to our families.
</p>
<p>Mom, having been a parent for almost 21 years, my greatest wish is I will be 
to my children what you are to me.  I treasure your unconditional love and support.  
I am going to borrow the words of a song to describe those feelings (I got your ability 
to carry a tune, so I won't sing):

<p align=center><b>Burt 50<sup>th</sup> Birthday</b><br>August 15, 1999</p>
<blockquote>
You were my strength when I was weak;<br>
You were my voice when I couldn't speak;<br>
You were my eyes when I couldn't see, you saw the best there was in me.<br>
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach;<br>
You gave me faith, 'cause you believed;<br>
I'm everything I am because you loved me!<br>
One half century ago tonight<br>
Was our parents' last evening of peace and quiet.<br>
On August 15th, 1949<br>
Elaine and Gerry Nadler left their tranquility behind.<br>
<br>
You came into the world loved and adored<br>
Even before the doctor cut the cord.<br>
What to name you became a burden<br>
But because it had six letters, you became Burton.<br>
<br>
You cried and kvetched, they thought time would never pass,<br>
But the doctor said it was temporary for alas, it was gas.<br>
For two and half years you were their pride and joy,<br>
Their only child, their perfect little boy.<br>
<br>
Little did you know other plans were being made,<br>
Along came me, your sister, and you watched your old world fade.<br>
What were they thinking?  What have they done?<br>
And three years later, they added another son!?!<br>
<br>
Life moved on, but it was never the same,<br>
You had to share and take turns, how could life get so lame?<br>
As you grew up you went through "normal" stages,<br>
Embarrassed to be seen with us, for your friends were your gauges.<br>
<br>
Your teenage years took place during the sixties,<br>
You rebelled against the establishment with all those other hippies.<br>
You traveled about guided only by fate,<br>
I'm sure still wanted in several states.<br>
<br>
In search of yourself, determined not to fail,<br>
I got the call, "Can you bail me out of jail?"<br>
You survived those years and saw the light,<br>
You needed an education to live the good life.<br>
<br>
You went to law school to be an advocate for the needy,<br>
And soon realized it was OK to be a little greedy.<br>
When finally you took Barbara Sard as your wife,<br>
We were relieved someone else would look after your life.<br>
<br>
You worked hard to be successful, you were never lax,<br>
But your best endeavor was to beget Cory and Max.<br>
A more devoted family man can never be found,<br>
Whenever you are needed, you're always around.<br>
<br>
As big brothers go, you are a must,<br>
I know I can count on you and in you I trust.<br>
Our families are close, our children are friends,<br>
Let's hope these relationships last 'til the end.<br>
<br>
I look forward to, from the bottom of my heart,<br>
Being there for each other 'til death do us part.<br>
<br>
<b>Happy 50th Birthday!!!!!</b><br>

<blockquote>
<b>MY DAD</b><br>
<br>
You're the 3rd of 4 sons of Minnie and Sam<br>
Who brought you up with a very strict hand.<br>
I have learned, of late; you pulled some pranks,<br>
But were smart enough to outwit the ranks.<br>
<br>
In a clothing store you worked for your dad<br>
Which you really only liked a tad.<br>
Academics became an early passion<br>
Because you didn't want a life in fashion.<br>
<br>
So you excelled in school and to college you went<br>
But you weren't sure for what you were meant.<br>
You kept taking courses until, alas,<br>
You took an engineering class.<br>
<br>
You saw the light and your future looked bright<br>
You planned and designed, but not all was right.<br>
Life was good, but clearly mundane<br>
Until, of course, you met Elaine.<br>
<br>
You fell in love and thought it was heaven<br>
Hence you married in June of '47.<br>
Life was bliss, what more could there be<br>
You finished Purdue with a PhD.<br>
<br>
With your career underway and a really good job<br>
Within 6 years you begat Burt, Jan & Bob.<br>
Mom wanted to have child #4<br>
You took one look at us and said "No more."<br>
<br>
Your fun was your work and your work was your fun<br>
Which has been rewarded with success and recognition.<br>
You provided us with travel and adventure<br>
What a lucky and thankful family we were.<br>
<br>
The real purpose of life and these are the facts,<br>
Became Joshua, Carly, Ali, Cory, Dana, and Max.<br>
Because of your love and generosity<br>
We've been able to stay a close family.<br>
<br>
From you I have learned how to live and to be - <br>
Honest and moral with integrity.<br>
You have accomplished so much, and for that I am glad,<br>
But most important to me is that you're my Dad.<br>
<br>
<b>I LOVE YOU!!<br>
HAPPY 80th BIRTHDAY!<br></b>
<br>
And I thank you from the bottom of my heart - Happy Birthday and many, many, many more!!

<blockquote>
An ideal family of four we were,<br>
A father, mother, a son and daughter.<br>
Your brother and I thought this is how it would stay,<br>
Until you came into our lives fifty years ago today.<br>
<br>
You were such a quiet little child,<br>
We never thought you could be wild.<br>
It became pretty clear, as the baby son,<br>
Of the three of us, you were the favorite one. <br>
<br>
A smile on your face you seemed to have all the time,<br>
However, it was hard to tell what was really on your mind.<br>
You rarely got in trouble, or so we thought.<br>
You were just smart enough not to get caught.<br>
 <br>
In your teenage years, of your interests you seemed unsure.<br>
Of course, now in hindsight, I'm sure it's all a blur.<br>
You graduated high school in 1973,<br>
Having no idea what you wanted to be.<br>
<br>
You went to Eau Claire with no path in sight,<br>
Until a college professor showed you the light.<br>
He said something of interest, of which you heard.<br>
From that point on you've been a nerd.<br>
<br>
Back to Madison you did flee<br>
To earn yourself a couple of degrees.<br>
You always work hard and you never dally.<br>
But your greatest success has been Dana and Ali.<br>
<br>
A more devoted father; there is none around.<br>
Whenever you are needed, you can be found.<br>
To this day you are quiet as a mouse.<br>
It's hard to believe you can suck the fun out of a house.<br>
<br>
Throughout your life I've told with you a lot,<br>
That I'd always look down on you, no matter how tall you got.<br>
Now that you're fifty, the truth can be told,<br>
As little brothers go, you are one to behold.<br>
<br>
<b>Happy 50th Birthday!!!</b><br>
